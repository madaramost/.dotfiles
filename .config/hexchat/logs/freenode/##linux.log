Jun 10 06:14:59 <terabit[m]>	twainwek: what's wrong with gpg? I think you're using git wrong maybe. it's there for code management not data storage. if your code isn't public make the repo itself private. I personally don't know of other approaches

Jun 10 07:04:35 <terabit[m]>	codeahol1c: yeah, I'm convinced at least in the US, they expect everyone to have a a particular personality. most coders do their best work at 2am when nobody is around. open offices, conference calls all the time,etc...
Jun 10 07:04:40 <justsomeguy>	Why do big orgs think making their own OS is an easy thing?!

Jun 10 07:07:40 <luke-jr>	foofbug: poor architecture, and everyone making x86 chips includes backdoors
