Jun 09 05:45:28 <Henry151>	i am reading here https://medium.com/@amimahloof/how-to-package-a-python-project-with-all-of-its-dependencies-for-offline-install-7eb240b27418 what i found when googling about my line of inquiry but i am still feeling like this looks horribly insuffecient
Jun 09 05:46:23 <Henry151>	it still is something that requires, at the end of it all, the end user to do things like extract the archive and run "pip install -r requirements.txt --use-wheel --no-index --find-links wheelhouse"
Jun 09 05:47:06 <Henry151>	i want to learn to wrap things up so well that you can just download, set executable, and run it
Jun 09 05:47:22 <Henry151>	or download it, dbkg -i it, and run it
Jun 09 05:47:31 <Henry151>	dbkg/dpkg

Jun 09 06:00:28 <Henry151>	also, if i start a venv with python3 -m venv env, then activate it with ./env/bin/activate ; now do i need to run pip with ./env/bin/pip install thing? or do i just run pip install thing?

Jun 11 15:08:18 <ekleog>	Hmm any idea where `_install` of lib/python3.7/importlib/_bootstrap.py is called from?

Jun 11 15:08:49 <hiyosilver>	Hello, good morning, best way in python to know response time or load page of a website?
Jun 11 15:08:52 <chunkypuffs>	The other things have been vaguely mentioned, you assume I know everything
Jun 11 15:08:57 <chunkypuffs>	you assume I know what you mean when you say toml
Jun 11 15:09:03 <ikanobori>	hiyosilver: By timing it, how depends on what you're using to access this page :)
Jun 11 15:09:05 <chunkypuffs>	I've asked, but you just throw me another bone.
Jun 11 15:09:07 <altendky>	chunkypuffs: ok, then use multiple files with a proper setup.py and project layout and appdirs to pick the config location and toml for the config format
Jun 11 15:09:22 <tshirtman>	ekleog: using python -v is useful to see what causes imports
Jun 11 15:09:27 <chunkypuffs>	setup.py is too complex for the stage I'm at
Jun 11 15:09:32 <ikanobori>	chunkypuffs: TOML is 'Tom's Obvious Minimal Language', a commonly used configuration language format.
Jun 11 15:09:44 <altendky>	chunkypuffs: and at least use argparse to create a cli if a cli is what you want

Jun 11 15:10:49 <chunkypuffs>	There's so much in the documentation for argparse, I'm having trouble understanding how to just run code via -x

Jun 11 15:12:09 <chunkypuffs>	So when I actually understand how to do a basic thing, I'm sure I'll expand on my own.
Jun 11 15:12:12 <altendky>	chunkypuffs: you don't know what they are, how would you know if you care?
Jun 11 15:12:24 <chunkypuffs>	altendky, I don't know, did you ever learn how to use linux?
Jun 11 15:12:36 <altendky>	chunkypuffs: yes, 20+ years ago
Jun 11 15:12:38 <chunkypuffs>	It would be very strange if you learned how to use a console with someone yelling names of things at you
