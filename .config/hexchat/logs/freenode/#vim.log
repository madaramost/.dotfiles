Jun 09 06:17:07 <brandonkal>	For the mac users, I started really diving into learning more vim shortcuts and am hooked. Do you know of a way to use at least the basic shortcuts in a normal app. I see vim-anywhere, but it seems to be mostly a shortcut to copy and paste between the terminal.

Jun 09 06:28:24 <brandonkal>	tejr, that looks quite similar to vim-anywhere. I opened up my mac screenwriting app (Slugline) It's mostly markdown with specific formatting and keyboard shortcuts. Thought it would be cool to use vim movement commands in such apps.
Jun 09 06:29:10 <tejr>	I think generally people look for plugins specific to the application
Jun 09 06:29:49 <tejr>	The only thing I can find is this https://medium.com/@dnlholliday/why-every-screenwriter-should-learn-vim-ee4a588ee7f
Jun 09 06:29:51 <brandonkal>	Yes, it seems like it is a matter of asking each app developer to add the features.
